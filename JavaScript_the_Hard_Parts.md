# The Hard Parts
## JS Principles
### Notes
*Reminder: JS is single threaded(it can only run 1 execution context at a time, no matter what)*
**Execution Context**- created to run a function, and contains 2 parts (memory and thread of execution)
**Parameter**- the input name in a function
**Argument**- the actual value assigned to the parameter name
**Call Stack**- the structure that keeps track of what is being run. It operates as a "last in, first out" (think stack of plates)
